# Overview

I am back again to blogging my yearly reflection after a break of 2 years. Firstly, I want to be honest about the reason I didn‚Äôt write for the 2 years. Simple answer is I didn‚Äôt have the motivation. I know that is quite easy thing to say but needs a much deeper introspection. Did I get lazy? Was the year too overwhelming? I don‚Äôt have a clear answer yet but have some general notes. 2020 and 2021 were covid years filled with horrible covid stories, I didn‚Äôt particularly want to relive those. Also staying in the home comfort since it was lockdown, and I was back in my hometown made me kind of laid back and take it slow.

Despite all the hardships, I feel those 2 years taught me a lot about myself. And most glaring is the fickleness of life. This had a profound impact on my various mental models which I will try to touch in the article. But let‚Äôs move on and try to turn a new leaf from this year. I have promised myself now to do this every year. The key here would be discipline, so from next time there would be no excuse of lack of motivation üòõ.

Coming back to this year, I feel this year has been one of the most defining years of my life. There was experience which I never thought I would gain in my entire life.

Biggest news of year 2022:-

1.  Got a job @Meta (FAANG dream)
2.  Moved from Delhi (India) to London (UK).
3.  Met king of UK üòõ

## Highlights

### Career Growth

This has to start with the biggest change. I switched my jobs from MediaNet to Meta at London. I had no plans for such a switch but got approached by meta recruiter which ignited my interest. And the reason they were able to find me was a good LinkedIn profile. If you want to learn the exact way to design LinkedIn, you can watch [this](<[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwG9TC0b1dU)>) video. So luckily, I was able to clear the interview loop and moved from Delhi to London.

Though technically a career switch is not equivalent to career growth per se, but in my case all my jobs involved different kind of exposure. BrowserStack was a SaaS start-up where focus was towards growth of the business, bringing in more customers. MediaNet(B2C) was more stable business where keeping business and incremental changes were top priorities. Meta currently in this phase of protect and increase the revenue. This gives me lot of exposure into various lifecycles of a company. I can choose where I want to work.

Another critical point is to realise the area of software development you are interested in. It can be android, iOS, backend development etc. Even each of these categories has so many subcategories. For example, I am a backend engineer. I like to work in a team that is close to the product, where any change I make and can see real-time customer impact.

### Travelling

In two years, I couldn‚Äôt travel much due to covid restriction. So, in 2022 I decided to be at my travel best. General guideline was to not lose any travel opportunity due to some made up stupid reason in my mind. Prioritise things I like and just do them and travelling happens to be one of them. Whether it is hiking, exploring unfamiliar places, observing new cultures, I like it all.

This realisation and the change in mental model came after covid restrictions. I rued over the fact that I didn‚Äôt travel much when in pre covid era. I was too engrossed in myself that I let the time slip by. Also, another thought that changed my model, was something that my friend told me. This is the sweet spot where we have the combination of freedom, money and energy.

I travelled extensively in UK. Again, my most of the plans were impromptu. Planning every trip just 3-4 days before the actual departure. To name a few places, I travelled to Bristol, Scotland, Wales and many other places. The best part travelling here is I get to see untouched nature. Hikes here though less strenuous than Himalayas but are incredibly beautiful.

### Health, Fitness and Nutrition

With all the gyms and covid restrictions in place, all the progress I had made in 2019 and 2020 almost went to gutter. All the gains were lost by the mid of 2022. I just had the experience of training from 2019. So, I again started building up and hitting the gym. I am proud of the fact that I could make gym a habit. So now each day that I don‚Äôt go to gym I feel kind of guilty and next day take an immediate action. Consistency is the key, even when other things seemed difficult persisted with gym.

For me fitness is not only going to the gym. The progress in my running has been amazing. I did my first 5K this year under 6‚Äù/km. I sometimes did 10Ks as well. Attended few of HIIT classes. Played various games like badminton, table tennis. Occasional days of swimming. And the long walks around the city. Loved exploring new stuff like rock climbing and kayaking. I will do any activity I like to complete my daily goal of 30min exercise and 900cal move goal.

Fitness trackers give me an extra motivation to keep my streaks and calorie burn going. It is clear to me; exercising IS my silent therapy. It keeps my mind sharp and energy levels up. If I do a challenging thing in the morning, other tasks in the day automatically falls into place. It is like a highlight of the day and gives a unique belief that I can achieve anything.

I realised how bad air pollution affects my health after living in Uk for some time and go back to India. I can instantly feel the smog and difficulty in breathing in Delhi. And I got ill for a week due to the pollution.

I keep experimenting with my nutrition and the trend continued. I tried eating limited gluten, protein-based diet, plant based and so on. Things that stuck with are Streaks where I don‚Äôt consume sugar for weeks are awesome. Somehow those days body feels but easier to work with. But those are extremely difficult and rare since I am a dessert lover. Second is replacing one meal in the day with my favourite salad. Third change that I liked but was extreme is the increased productivity with hunger. I would directly eat the lunch, had amazing morning with work.

### Reading

I again read less than what I expected. I think I read total of 4 books this year. I know that is quite a small number üò≠. Some of the books I read were quite good. This year reading recommendation would be **7 habits of highly effective people**. It is an amazing book, based upon the life principles and improving the mental models.

### Finance

I opened my stock market account in 2020, stock market was the new fad in India. This paved my way into the world of finance, boosted by the growth of finance channels on YouTube. These YT channels taught me value of investing and starting early. I got much interested into these instruments and discuss regular with my friends about these. I am also learning much about the various strategies in stock market. Tried making some algorithms as well which didn‚Äôt work that well üòõ. With so much interest in the finance world, I am sure it will open some doors in the future.

P.S - I strongly suggest everyone to start investing, in any instrument of your risk appetite. Risk: FD < Gold < Bonds < MF < Stocks. Hit me up if anyone wants to discuss anything about finance.

### Misc

Everything is not rosy as it sounds, it is difficult to live far from the family. The possibility of only able to visit them twice per year kind of breaks my heart. This teaches an important lesson of not taking anyone for granted. Life of comfort is much easier to live but the life with hardship is much rewarding. Just like muscle fibre, human beings only grow when are hurt.

Thanks for reading. Look out for the next post on the my 2023 goals..
